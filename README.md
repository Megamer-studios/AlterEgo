## ðŸ›  Code Overview

### ðŸ“Œ `Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)`
- Initializes the UI and loads the default character sprite.
- Configures the speech synthesizer to use a **female voice**.
- Sets console text color for debugging.

### ðŸ¤– `GetChatGPTResponse(string prompt)`
- Sends user input to OpenAI's GPT model.
- Implements **exponential backoff retry logic** for handling API rate limits.
- Returns the AI-generated response or an error message if unsuccessful.

### ðŸŽ¤ `RecogniseSpeech()`
- Uses `SpeechRecognitionEngine` to capture and transcribe speech.
- Displays the recognized text in `richTextBox1`.
- Passes the transcribed text to the AI via `oshit(result.Text)`.

### ðŸ’¬ `oshit(string pr)`
- Sends the recognized speech or text input to OpenAI.
- **Updates** `richTextBox2` with the AI-generated response.
- Uses `synth.Speak(response)` to read the response aloud.
- Activates a **timer** to trigger character animations.

### ðŸŽ­ `timer1_Tick(object sender, EventArgs e)`
- **Randomly selects** one of five character sprites to display.
- Creates a more **dynamic and engaging** user interface.

### ðŸŽ› `button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)`
- Triggers **speech recognition** when the user clicks Button 1.
